# NotHack

A simple rougelike game made for an assignment.

Code is far from pretty, it may cause you to throw up. You have been warned.

# NOTE!

This was made for a school assignment a few years ago, and I should really remove this repository because the code is not pretty. It was my first real thing I made in C++ after all. Not that my code has gotten much prettier since then.
